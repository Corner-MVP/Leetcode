# 207. Course Schedule

## Description
There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

- For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

## Examples
### example 1
```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```

### example 2
```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

### constraints
- $1 <= numCourses <= 10^5$
- `0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000`
- `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= ai, bi < numCourses`
- All the pairs prerequisites[i] are **unique**.

## Idea
This is a classical topological sorting question. This question is equal to find whether this directed graph has a cycle or not. If the graph does not have a cycle, it means all courses can be finished and vice verse. We can set all courses with three states, `0 - will finish`, `1 - fishing`, `2 - finished`. We can traverse all courses and start from each course to judge whether the path has a cycle. If the path include node with state `1`, which means there is a cycle in this path. If the path arrive node with state `2` indicating that there is no cycle in the future. If meet state `0`, remark this node with state `1` and continue to find subsequent nodes until a state `2` node is found. Finally, if it reaches the state of nowhere to go, it means that the current node is safe.

## Code
### Python
```
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses, prerequisites):
        relation = defaultdict(list)
        for group in prerequisites:
            child, parent = group[0], group[1]
            relation[parent].append(child)
        
        visit = [0 for i in range(numCourses)]
        
        def DFS(node):
            if visit[node] == 1: 
                return False
            if visit[node] == 2: 
                return True

            visit[node] = 1
            for nextNode in relation[node]:
                if not DFS(nextNode):
                    return False

            visit[node] = 2
            
            return True
        
        for course in range(numCourses):
            if not DFS(course):
                return False
        return True
```

### JavaScript
```
/**
 * @param {number} numCourses
 * @param {number[][]} prerequisites
 * @return {boolean}
 */
 var canFinish = function(numCourses, prerequisites) {

    const relation = new Map()
    for (const group of prerequisites) {
      const child = group[0], parent = group[1]
      relation.get(parent) ? relation.get(parent).push(child) : relation.set(parent, [child])
    }

    const visited = new Array(numCourses).fill(0)

    const dfs = (node) => {

      if (visited[node] === 1) return false
      if (visited[node] === 2) return true
      
      visited[node] = 1
      if (relation.get(node)) {
        for (const nextNode of relation.get(node)) {
          if (!dfs(nextNode)) return false
        }
      }

      visited[node] = 2
      return true

    }

    for (let course = 0; course < numCourses; course++) {
      if (!dfs(course)) return false
    }
    return true

};
```

## Time and space complexity
- time complexity: $O(n)$, `n` is the number of courses, all the vertex just need to traverse at most once;
- space complexity: $O(n)$, `n` is the number of courses. `visited` array need $O(n)$ space to store each vertex state.
