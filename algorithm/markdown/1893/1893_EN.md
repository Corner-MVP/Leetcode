# 1893. Check if All the Integers in a Range Are Covered

## Description
You are given a 2D integer array `ranges` and two integers `left` and `right`. Each `ranges[i] = [starti, endi]` represents an **inclusive** interval between `starti` and `endi`.

Return `true` *if each integer in the inclusive range* `[left, right]` *is covered by **at least one** interval in* `ranges`. Return `false` *otherwise*.

An integer `x` is covered by an interval `ranges[i] = [starti, endi]` if `starti <= x <= endi`.

## Examples
### example 1
```
Input: ranges = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]], left = 2, right = 5
Output: true
Explanation: Every integer between 2 and 5 is covered:
- 2 is covered by the first range.
- 3 and 4 are covered by the second range.
- 5 is covered by the third range.
```

### example 2
```
Input: ranges = [[1,10],[10,20]], left = 21, right = 21
Output: false
Explanation: 21 is not covered by any range.
```

### constraints
- `1 <= ranges.length <= 50`
- `1 <= starti <= endi <= 50`
- `1 <= left <= right <= 50`

## Idea
In order to determine whether all the numbers in the interval are covered, an array `arr` is maintained, and the elements of the array represent the coverage of the current number.

Brute-force solution is traverse all the ranges of `ranges` `[l, r]`, add 1 to each integer in the range, after the traversal, check the array `arr`, and the range of `[left, right]` Whether each integer is greater than 0, if it is, it returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`. The time complexity is $O(\sum_{0}^{len(ranges)}(r-l) * n)$, where `n` is the length of the array `ranges`, `\sum_{0}^{len (ranges)(rl)}` is the sum of the left and right intervals in the array `ranges`.

The time complexity of brute-force solution is too high. In order to reduce the time complexity, iterating over each integer in the `ranges` array is an optional method. This can use the difference array to maintain the amount of change in the number of intervals covered by two adjacent integers, where `diff[i]` corresponds to the number of intervals covering the integer `i` relative to the number of intervals covering `i-1` quantity. In this way, when traversing to the closed interval `[l, r]`, `l` has more covered intervals than `l-1` by `1`, and `r+1` has less covered intervals than `r` by 1` `. Corresponding to the difference array, we need to add 1 to `diff[l]` and subtract 1 from `diff[r+1]`.

After maintaining the difference array `diff`, traverse `diff` to find the prefix sum to obtain the number of intervals covering each integer. The number of covered intervals corresponding to the subscript `i` is the initial number `0` plus the sum of the changes of the closed interval `[1, i]`. While calculating the number of covered intervals, we can also determine whether all integers in the closed interval of `[left, right]` are covered.

## Code
### Python
```
class Solution:
    def isCovered(self, ranges, left, right):

        diff = [0 for _ in range(52)]
        for l, r in ranges:
            diff[l] += 1
            diff[r+1] -= 1
        
        curr = 0
        for i in range(1, 51):
            curr += diff[i]
            if left <= i <= right and curr <= 0:
                return False
        
        return True
```

### JavaScript
```
/**
 * @param {number[][]} ranges
 * @param {number} left
 * @param {number} right
 * @return {boolean}
 */
 var isCovered = function(ranges, left, right) {
    const diff = new Array(52).fill(0)
    for (const pair of ranges) {
        diff[pair[0]] += 1
        diff[pair[1] + 1] -= 1
    }

    let curr = 0
    for (let i = 0; i < 51; i++) {
        curr += diff[i]
        if (i >= left && i <= right && curr <=0) return false
    }

    return true
};
```

## Time and space complexity
- Time complexity: $O(n + l)$, `n` is the length of `ranges` and `l` is the length of `diff`. The complexity of initializing the `diff` array is $O(l)$, traversing `ranges` array's complexity is $O(n)$ and the time complexity of solving the `prefix` sum and judging whether it is completely covered is $O(l)$;
- Space complexity: $O(l)$, `l` is the length of `diff`
