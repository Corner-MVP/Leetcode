# 210. Course Schedule II

## Description
There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

- For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return *the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses*. If there are many valid answers, return **any** of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return **an empty array**.

## Examples
### example 1
```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].
```

### example 2
```
Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,2,1,3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].
```

### example 3
```
Input: numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []
Output: [0]
```

### constraints
- `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
- `0 <= prerequisites.length <= numCourses * (numCourses - 1)`
- `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= ai, bi < numCourses`
- $a_i != b_i$
- All the pairs $[a_i, b_i]$ are **distinct**.

## Idea
This question is similar with [207](./../207/207_EN.md). The only difference of solution is the final need to return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses. It not hardly to find the final answer is the sequence that vertex turns to state `2`. Therefore, setting the array `order` represents the final answer. When a vertex's state turns to `2`, add this vertex into order. And the final answer is reversed `order`.

## Code
### Python
```
from collections import defaultdict
class Solution:
    def findOrder(self, numCourses, prerequisites):
        relation = defaultdict(list)
        for group in prerequisites:
            child, parent = group[0], group[1]
            relation[parent].append(child)
        
        visit = [0 for i in range(numCourses)]
        order = []
        
        def DFS(node):
            
            if visit[node] == 1: 
                return False
            if visit[node] == 2: 
                return True


            visit[node] = 1
            for nextNode in relation[node]:
                if not DFS(nextNode):
                    return False


            visit[node] = 2
            order.append(node)
            return True
        
        for course in range(numCourses):
            if visit[course] == 0:
                if not DFS(course):
                    return []
        return order[::-1]
```

### JavaScript
```
/**
 * @param {number} numCourses
 * @param {number[][]} prerequisites
 * @return {number[]}
 */
 var findOrder = function(numCourses, prerequisites) {
    
  const relation = new Map()
  for (const group of prerequisites) {
    const child = group[0], parent = group[1]
    relation.get(parent) ? relation.get(parent).push(child) : relation.set(parent, [child])
  }

  const visited = new Array(numCourses).fill(0)
  const order = []

  const dfs = (node) => {

    if (visited[node] === 1) return false
    if (visited[node] === 2) return true
    
    visited[node] = 1
    if (relation.get(node)) {
      for (const nextNode of relation.get(node)) {
        if (!dfs(nextNode)) return false
      }
    }

    visited[node] = 2
    order.push(node)
    return true

  }

  for (let course = 0; course < numCourses; course++) {
    if (visited[course] === 0) {
      if (!dfs(course)) return []
    }
  }
  return order.reverse()

};
```

## Time and space complexity
- time complexity: $O(n)$, `n` is the number of courses, all the vertex just need to traverse at most once;
- space complexity: $O(n)$, `n` is the number of courses. both `visited` array and final answer need $O(n)$ space to store each vertex state.
