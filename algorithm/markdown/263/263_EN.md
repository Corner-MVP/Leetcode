# 263. Ugly Number

## Description
An **ugly number** is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to `2`, `3`, and `5`.

Given an integer `n`, return `true` *if* `n` *is an **ugly number***.

## Examples
### example 1
```
Input: n = 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 × 3
```

### example 2
```
Input: n = 8
Output: true
Explanation: 8 = 2 × 2 × 2
```

### example 3
```
Input: n = 14
Output: false
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.
```

### example 4
```
Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
```

### constraints
- $-2^31 <= n <= 2^31 - 1$

## Idea
From the ulgy number defition, we can know that the ugly number is combined with at most three factros that are 2, 3 and/or 5. Therefore, every ugly number `n` can be rewrite as $n = 2 ^ {a} + 3 ^ {b} + 5 ^ {c}$ and $a \geq 0, b \geq 0, c \geq 0$.

In order to judge whether target number is ugly number. We can divisor 2, 3 and 5 until the number cannot be divisored by 2, 3 and 5. If the remaining number equals to 1, it indicates that the target number is ugly number and vice versa.

## Code
### Python
```
class Solution:
    def isUgly(self, n):
        if n <= 0: return False

        factors = [2, 3, 5]

        for factor in factors:
            while n % factor == 0:
                n //= factor
        
        return n == 1
```

### JavaScript
```
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isUgly = function(n) {
    if (n <= 0) return false

    const factors = [2, 3, 5]

    for (const factor of factors) {
      while (n % factor === 0) {
        n  = n / factor
      }
    }
    
    return n === 1
};
```

## Time and space complexity
- time complexity: $O(log(n))$, it depends on the times that `n` is divided by `2, 3, 5`. Since `n` is divided by `2` at least each time, the number of division operations will not exceed $O(log(n))$.
- space complexity: $O(1)$, $O(1)$ space used to store `factors`.
