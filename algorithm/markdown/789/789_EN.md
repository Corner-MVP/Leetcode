# 789. Escape The Ghosts

## Description
You are playing a simplified PAC-MAN game on an infinite 2-D grid. You start at the point `[0, 0]`, and you are given a destination point `target = [xtarget, ytarget]`, which you are trying to get to. There are several ghosts on the map with their starting positions given as an array `ghosts`, where `ghosts[i] = [xi, yi]` represents the starting position of the `ith` ghost. All inputs are **integral coordinates**.

Each turn, you and all the ghosts may independently choose to either **move 1 unit** in any of the four cardinal directions: north, east, south, or west or **stay still**. All actions happen **simultaneously**.

You escape if and only if you can reach the target **before** any ghost reaches you. If you reach any square (including the target) at the **same time** as a ghost, it **does not** count as an escape.

Return `true` *if it is possible to escape, otherwise return* `false`*.*

## Examples
### example 1
```
Input: ghosts = [[1,0],[0,3]], target = [0,1]
Output: true
Explanation: You can reach the destination (0, 1) after 1 turn, while the ghosts located at (1, 0) and (0, 3) cannot catch up with you.
```

### example 2
```
Input: ghosts = [[1,0]], target = [2,0]
Output: false
Explanation: You need to reach the destination (2, 0), but the ghost at (1, 0) lies between you and the destination.
```

### example 3
```
Input: ghosts = [[2,0]], target = [1,0]
Output: false
Explanation: The ghost can reach the target at the same time as you.
```

### example 4
```
Input: ghosts = [[5,0],[-10,-2],[0,-5],[-2,-2],[-7,1]], target = [7,7]
Output: false
```

### example 5
```
Input: ghosts = [[-1,0],[0,1],[-1,0],[0,1],[-1,0]], target = [0,0]
Output: true
```

### constraints
- `1 <= ghosts.length <= 100`
- `ghosts[i].length == 2`
- $-10^4 <= xi, yi <= 10^4$
- There can be **multiple ghosts** in the same location.
- `target.length == 2`
- $104 <= xtarget, ytarget <= 10^4$

## Idea
In order to know if the player can be captured by the `ghost` in the array `ghotsts`. The question is whether there is a shortest distance from the ghost to the target that is less than the shortest distance from the player. For each point in the **2D matrix**. The shortest distance between two points, assuming $point1(x_1, y_1), point2(x_2, y_2)$ is $abs(y_2-y_2) + abs(x_2-x_1)$. If the shortest distance of all `ghost` is greater than the distance of the player. Return `true` and vice versa.

## Code
### Python
```
class Solution:
    def escapeGhosts(self, ghosts, target) -> bool:
          start = [0, 0]
          distance = self.shortestDistance(start, target)

          return all(self.shortestDistance(ghost, target) > distance for ghost in ghosts)
    
    def shortestDistance(self, start, end):
          return abs(end[0] - start[0]) + abs(end[1] - start[1])
```

### JavaScript
```
/**
 * @param {number[][]} ghosts
 * @param {number[]} target
 * @return {boolean}
 */
 var escapeGhosts = function(ghosts, target) {
  const start = [0, 0];
  const distance = shortestDistance(start, target)
  for (const ghost of ghosts) {
      const ghostDistance = shortestDistance(ghost, target);
      if (ghostDistance <= distance) {
          return false;
      }
  }
  return true;
};

const shortestDistance = (start, end) => {
  return Math.abs(end[0] - start[0]) + Math.abs(end[1] - start[1]);
}
```

## Time and space complexity
- time complexity: $O(n)$, `n` is the length of array `ghosts`, traverse `ghosts` need $O(n)$' 
- space complexity: $O(1)$.
