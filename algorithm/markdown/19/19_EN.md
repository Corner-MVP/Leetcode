# 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

## Description
Given the `head` of a linked list, remove the $n^th$ node from the end of the list and return its head.

## Examples
### example 1

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]
```

### example 2
```
Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []
```

### example 3
```
Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]
```

### constraints
- The number of nodes in the list isÂ `sz`.
- `1 <= sz <= 30`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
- `1 <= n <= sz`

## Idea
It is a classical fast and slow pointers problem. In order to find Nth node from end of linked list, we can set two pointers and the fast one moves Nth steps in advance. When the fast one arrives the Nth node from start of linked list, the slow pointer starts to move at the same time with fast one until the fast one arrives the end of the linked list. At this time, the slow pointer is point to the Nth node from end of linked list.

In order to delete the Nth node from end of linked list, we can set a pre pointer to point to the father node of the slow node. When the slow pointer points to Nth node from the end, `pre.next = slow.next` to delete Nth node from the end

## Code
### Python
```
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        
        fast, slow, pre = dummy, dummy, dummy
        
        while n - 1:
            fast = fast.next
            n -= 1
        
        while fast.next:
            fast = fast.next
            pre = slow
            slow = slow.next
        
        pre.next = slow.next
        return dummy.next
```

### JavaScript
```
function ListNode(val, next) {
  this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
  this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next)
}
/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {ListNode}
 */
var removeNthFromEnd = function(head, n) {
    const dummy = new ListNode(0, head);
    let fast = dummy, slow = dummy, pre = dummy;
    while (n - 1 > 0) {
      fast = fast.next;
      n -= 1;
    }

    while (fast.next) {
      fast = fast.next
      pre = slow
      slow = slow.next
    }

    pre.next = slow.next
    return dummy.next
};
```

## Time and space complexity
- time complexity: $O(n)$, `n` is the length of Linked list;
- space complexity: $O(1)$.
