# 430. Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List

## Description
You are given a doubly linked list which in addition to the next and previous pointers, it could have a child pointer, which may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure, as shown in the example below.

Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. You are given the head of the first level of the list.

## Examples
### example 1
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]
Output: [1,2,3,7,8,11,12,9,10,4,5,6]
Explanation:

The multilevel linked list in the input is as follows:

`After flattening the multilevel linked list it becomes:`

### example 2
```
Input: head = [1,2,null,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
Explanation:

The input multilevel linked list is as follows:

  1---2---NULL
  |
  3---NULL
```

### constraints
- The number of Nodes will not exceedÂ `1000`.
- $1 <= Node.val <= 105$

## Idea
When we traverse to a certain node `node`, if its `child` is not empty, then we need to flatten the linked list structure which the `child` points to and insert between `node` and `node.next`.

Therefore, when meeting `child` is not empty, we must first process the linked list pointed to `child`, that is a **depth first seach** process. After we have completed the flattening of the linked list pointed to `child`, we can backtrack to the `node`.

In order to be able to insert a flat linked list between `node` and `node.next`, we need to know the last node of flattend linked list and store it.

## Code
### Python
```
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val, prev, next, child):
          self.val = val
          self.prev = prev
          self.next = next
          self.child = child

class Solution:
    def flatten(self, head):
        if not head: return

        dummy = Node(0, None, head, None)
        self.dfs(dummy, head)

        dummy.next.prev = None
        return dummy.next

    def dfs(self, prev, curr):
        if not curr:
          return prev
        
        curr.prev = prev
        prev.next = curr

        tempNext = curr.next
        tail = self.dfs(curr, curr.child)
        curr.child = None
        return self.dfs(tail, tempNext)
```

### JavaScript
```
function Node(val,prev,next,child) {
  this.val = val;
  this.prev = prev;
  this.next = next;
  this.child = child;
}

/**
 * @param {Node} head
 * @return {Node}
 */
var flatten = function(head) {
    if (!head) return

    const dummy = new Node(0)
    dummy.next = head;
    dfs(dummy, head)
    dummy.next.prev = null
    return dummy.next
};

const dfs = (prev, curr) => {
  if (!curr) return prev

  curr.prev = prev;
  prev.next = curr;

  const tempNext = curr.next;
  const tail = dfs(curr, curr.child);
  curr.child = null;
  return dfs(tail, tempNext)

}
```

## Time and space complexity
- time complexity: $O(n)$, `n` is the length of linked list.
- space complexity: $O(n)$, space is used in stack space for depth first seach.
