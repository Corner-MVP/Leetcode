# 725. Split Linked List in Parts

## Description
Given the `head` of a singly linked list and an integer `k`, split the linked list into `k` consecutive linked list parts.

The length of each part should be as equal as possible: no two parts should have a size differing by more than one. This may lead to some parts being null.

The parts should be in the order of occurrence in the input list, and parts occurring earlier should always have a size greater than or equal to parts occurring later.

Return *an array of the* `k` *parts*.

## Examples
### example 1

```
Input: head = [1,2,3], k = 5
Output: [[1],[2],[3],[],[]]
Explanation:
The first element output[0] has output[0].val = 1, output[0].next = null.
The last element output[4] is null, but its string representation as a ListNode is [].
```

### example 2
![https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/13/split2-lc.jpg](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/13/split2-lc.jpg)
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], k = 3
Output: [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7],[8,9,10]]
Explanation:
The input has been split into consecutive parts with size difference at most 1, and earlier parts are a larger size than the later parts.
```

### constraints
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 1000]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 1000`
- `1 <= k <= 50`

## Idea
In order to split the linked list, we need to get the length of linked list `length` by traversal at first. 

After getting `length`, $quotient = \lfloor \frac{length}{k} \rfloor$ and `remainder = length mod k`. It shows that in k parts, there are `remainder` parts that their length is `quotient + 1` and the remaining's length is `quotient`.

During spliting linked list, start from head node, current node is `curr` and the follow these steps

- take `curr` as head node of current part and store as `start`;
- calculate current part's length `len`;
- move `curr` in `len` steps, `curr` is the end node of current part;
- `curr` need to be splited from origin linked list and store next node as `nxt` before splitting;
- `next` pointer of `curr` points to `null`;
- `curr` points to `nxt`

Through above steps, we can get one part from origin linked list and repeat the above operations to get the final result.


## Code
### Python
```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
class Solution:
    def splitListToParts(self, root, k):
        length, node = 0, root
        
        while node:
            length += 1
            node = node.next
        
        n, remaining = divmod(length, k)
        
        # split the linked list
        res, curr = [], root
        
        for i in range(k):
            head = curr
            for _ in range(n + (i < remaining) - 1):
                if curr: curr = curr.next
            if curr:
                curr.next, curr = None, curr.next
            res.append(head)
        return res
```

### JavaScript
```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val, next) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {ListNode[]}
 */
 var splitListToParts = function(head, k) {
  let length = 0, curr = head;
  while (curr) {
      length += 1;
      curr = curr.next;
  }
  
  let n = Math.floor(length / k), remaining = length % k;
  
  const res = []; 
  curr = head;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
      const node = curr;
      const width = n + (i < remaining ? 1 : 0);
      for (let j = 1; j < width; j++) {
          if (curr) curr = curr.next;
      }
      if (curr) {
          const next = curr.next;
          curr.next = null;
          curr = next;
      }
      res.push(node);
  }
  
  return res
  
};
```

## Time and space complexity
- time complexity: $O(n)$, `n` is the length of linked list, there are two traverse to get the length of linked list and split linked list;
- space complexity: $O(1)$.
