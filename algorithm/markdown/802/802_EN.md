# 802. Find Eventual Safe States

## Description
We start at some node in a directed graph, and every turn, we walk along a directed edge of the graph. If we reach a terminal node (that is, it has no outgoing directed edges), we stop.

We define a starting node to be **safe** if we must eventually walk to a terminal node. More specifically, there is a natural number `k`, so that we must have stopped at a terminal node in less than `k` steps for **any choice of where to walk**.

Return *an array containing all the safe nodes of the graph*. The answer should be sorted in **ascending** order.

The directed graph has `n` nodes with labels from `0` to `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of `graph`. The graph is given in the following form: `graph[i]` is a list of labels `j` such that `(i, j)` is a directed edge of the graph, going from node `i` to node `j`.

## Examples

```
Input: graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]
Output: [2,4,5,6]
Explanation: The given graph is shown above.
```

### example 2
```
Input: graph = [[1,2,3,4],[1,2],[3,4],[0,4],[]]
Output: [4]
```

### constraints
- `n == graph.length`
- $1 <= n <= 10^4$
- `0 <= graph[i].length <= n`
- `graph[i]` is sorted in a strictly increasing order.
- The graph may contain self-loops.
- The number of edges in the graph will be in the range $[1, 4 * 10^4]$.

## Idea

## Code
### Python
```
class Solution:
    def eventualSafeNodes(self, graph):
      length = len(graph)
      color = [0 for _ in range(length)]
      return [i for i in range(length) if self.isSafety(i, color, graph)]
    
    def isSafety(self, node, color, graph):
      if color[node]:
        return color[node] == 2
      
      color[node] = 1
      for i in graph[node]:
          if not self.isSafety(i, color, graph):
            return False
      color[node] = 2
      return True
```

### JavaScript
```
/**
 * @param {number[][]} graph
 * @return {number[]}
 */
 var eventualSafeNodes = function(graph) {
    
  const n = graph.length
  const color = new Array(n).fill(0)

  const dfs = (node) => {

    if (color[node] > 0) {
      return color[node] === 2
    }
    color[node] = 1
    for (const nextNode of graph[node]) {
      if (!dfs(nextNode)) return false
    }
    color[node] = 2
    return true

  }
  const res = []
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    dfs(i) ? res.push(i) : null
  }
  return res

};
```
