# 1846. Maximum Element After Decreasing and Rearranging

## Description
You are given an array of positive integers `arr`. Perform some operations (possibly none) on `arr` so that it satisfies these conditions:

- The value of the **first** element in `arr` must be `1`.
- The absolute difference between any 2 adjacent elements must be **less than or equal to** `1`. In other words, `abs(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) <= 1` for each `i` where `1 <= i < arr.length` (**0-indexed**). `abs(x)` is the absolute value of `x`.

There are 2 types of operations that you can perform any number of times:

- **Decrease** the value of any element of `arr` to a **smaller positive integer**.
- **Rearrange** the elements of `arr` to be in any order.

Return *the **maximum** possible value of an element in* `arr` *after performing the operations to satisfy the conditions*.

## Examples
### example 1

```
Input: arr = [2,2,1,2,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
We can satisfy the conditions by rearranging arr so it becomes [1,2,2,2,1].
The largest element in arr is 2.
```

### example 2

```
Input: arr = [100,1,1000]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
One possible way to satisfy the conditions is by doing the following:
1. Rearrange arr so it becomes [1,100,1000].
2. Decrease the value of the second element to 2.
3. Decrease the value of the third element to 3.
Now arr = [1,2,3], which satisfies the conditions.
The largest element in arr is 3.
```

### example 3

```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 5
Explanation: The array already satisfies the conditions, and the largest element is 5.
```

### constraints:

- $1 <= arr.length <= 10^5$
- $1 <= arr[i] <= 10^5$

## Idea
This question requires `|arr[i]-arr[i-1]| <= 1` and `arr[0] == 1`, so in order to find the maximum possible value in `arr`, you need `arr[i] -arr[i-1] = 1` as many as possible, so you can maintain an array `res` to represent an array that meets the requirements of the topic, sort `arr`, and judge `arr[i]` and `res[i after sorting -1]` the size relationship

-If `arr[i] >= res[i-1] + 1`, it means that `arr[i]` can get `res[i-1] + 1` by reducing the value, so `res[i] = res[i-1] + 1`
-If `arr[i] <res[i-1] + 1`, it means that `arr[i]` cannot get `res[i-1] + 1` by reducing the value, so `res[i] = res [i-1]`

The last value of the final array `res` is the final answer.

## Code
### Python
```
class Solution:
    def maximumElementAfterDecrementingAndRearranging(self, arr):
        arr.sort()
        res = [1]

        for i in range(1, len(arr)):
            target = res[i-1] + 1
            if arr[i] >= target:
                res.append(target)
            else:
                res.append(target-1)
        
        return res[len(arr) - 1]
```

### JavaScript
```
var maximumElementAfterDecrementingAndRearranging = function(arr) {

    arr.sort( (a, b) => a - b)
    const res = [1]

    for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        target = res[i-1] + 1
        if (arr[i] >= target) {
            res.push(target)
        } else {
            res.push(target-1)
        }
    }

    return res[arr.length - 1]

};
```

## Time and space complexity
- 时间复杂度: $O(nlog(n))$, `n` is the length of `arr`, it needs $O(nlog(n))$ to sort array and traversal need $O(n)$, therefore, the total time complexity is $O(nlog(n))$;
- 空间复杂度: `n` is the length of `arr`, it needs an auxiliary array of length `n`.
