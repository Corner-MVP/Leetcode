# 413. Arithmetic Slices

## Description
An integer array is called arithmetic if it consists of **at least three elements** and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

- For example, `[1,3,5,7,9]`, `[7,7,7,7]`, and `[3,-1,-5,-9]` are arithmetic sequences.

Given an integer array `nums`, return *the number of arithmetic **subarrays** of* `nums`.

A **subarray** is a contiguous subsequence of the array.

## Examples
### example 1
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 3
Explanation: We have 3 arithmetic slices in nums: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] and [1,2,3,4] itself.
```

### example 2
```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 0
```

### constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
- `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

## Idea
The arithmetic sequence has the same difference, therefore, the difference is `gap = nums[i] - nums[i-1]`. From the defition, since the length of arithmetic sequence is at least 3, at the begining, we can set the length of sequence `length` equals 0 and initial difference is `gap = nums[1] - nums[0]`, which means there are two consecutive elements have same difference. And then we traverse the `nums`, there are two conditions:

- `nums[i] - nums[i-1] == gap`, which means currrent element also has same differece, thus, `length += 1`
- `nums[i] - nums[i-1] != gap` that current element has different gap than before. We need reset `gap = nums[i] - nums[i-1]` and the `length = 0`

For the final answer, when `length = i - 1`, there are $\frac{(1 + i -1) * (i - 1)}{2} = \frac{i(i-1)}{2}$ arithmetic sequence and when `length = i`, there are $\frac{(1 + i) * i}{2} = \frac{i(i+1)}{2}$. It indicates that when arithmetic sequence add 1, there are more $\frac{i(i+1)}{2} - \frac{i(i-1)}{2} = i$ kinds. Therefore, when the length of arithmetic sequence is `i`, the number of arithmetic subarrays will add `i`.

## Code
### Python
```
class Solution:
    def numberOfArithmeticSlices(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        if n <= 2: return 0
        gap, length, res = nums[1] - nums[0], 0, 0

        for i in range(2, n):
            if nums[i] - nums[i-1] == gap:
                length += 1
            else:
                gap = nums[i] - nums[i-1]
                length = 0
            res += length
        
        return res
```

### JavaScript
```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var numberOfArithmeticSlices = function(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    if (n <= 2) return 0;
    let gap = nums[1] - nums[0], length = 0, res = 0;
    for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {
      if (nums[i] - nums[i-1] === gap) {
        length += 1;
      } else {
        gap = nums[i] - nums[i-1]
        length = 0;
      }
      res += length;
    }


    return res;

};
```

## Time and space complexity
- time complexity: $O(n)$, `n` is the length of `nums`;
- space complexity: $O(1)$.
