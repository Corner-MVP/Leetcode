# Intersection of Two Linked Lists
## Description
Given the heads of two singly linked-lists `headA` and `headB`, return *the node at which the two lists intersect*. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.

For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node `c1`:

It is **guaranteed** that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

**Note** that the linked lists must **retain their original structure** after the function returns.

## Example
### example1
```
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Intersected at '8'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
```

### example2
```
Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Intersected at '2'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.
```

### example3
```
Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: No intersection
Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
```

### constraints
- The number of nodes of `listA` is in the `m`.
- The number of nodes of `listB` is in the `n`.
- $0 <= m, n <= 3 * 10^4$
- $1 <= Node.val <= 10^5$
- `0 <= skipA <= m`
- `0 <= skipB <= n`
- `intersectVal` is `0` if `listA` and `listB` do not intersect.
- `intersectVal == listA[skipA + 1] == listB[skipB + 1]` if `listA` and `listB` intersect.

## Idea

## Code
### Python
```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA, headB):
        
        if not headA or not headB: return
        
        pA, pB = headA, headB
        
        while pA != pB:
            
            pA = headB if not pA else pA.next
            pB = headA if not pB else pB.next
        
        return pA
```
### JavaScript
```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.next = null;
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {ListNode} headA
 * @param {ListNode} headB
 * @return {ListNode}
 */
 var getIntersectionNode = function(headA, headB) {
    if (!headA || !headB) return null
    
    let p1 = headA, p2 = headB
    
    while (p1 !== p2) {
        p1 = p1 === null ? headB : p1.next
        p2 = p2 === null ? headA : p2.next
    }
    
    return p1
    
};
```
## Time and space complexity
- Time complexity: $O(n)$, `n` is the total length of two linked list;
- Space complexity: $O(1)$.
