# 1893. Check if All the Integers in a Range Are Covered

## Description
You are given a 2D integer array `ranges` and two integers `left` and `right`. Each `ranges[i] = [starti, endi]` represents an **inclusive** interval between `starti` and `endi`.

Return `true` *if each integer in the inclusive range* `[left, right]` *is covered by **at least one** interval in* `ranges`. Return `false` *otherwise*.

An integer `x` is covered by an interval `ranges[i] = [starti, endi]` if `starti <= x <= endi`.

## Examples
### example 1
```
Input: ranges = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]], left = 2, right = 5
Output: true
Explanation: Every integer between 2 and 5 is covered:
- 2 is covered by the first range.
- 3 and 4 are covered by the second range.
- 5 is covered by the third range.
```

### example 2
```
Input: ranges = [[1,10],[10,20]], left = 21, right = 21
Output: false
Explanation: 21 is not covered by any range.
```

### constraints
- `1 <= ranges.length <= 50`
- `1 <= starti <= endi <= 50`
- `1 <= left <= right <= 50`

## Idea

## Code
### Python
```
class Solution:
    def isCovered(self, ranges, left, right):

        diff = [0 for _ in range(52)]
        for l, r in ranges:
            diff[l] += 1
            diff[r+1] -= 1
        
        curr = 0
        for i in range(1, 51):
            curr += diff[i]
            if left <= i <= right and curr <= 0:
                return False
        
        return True
```

### JavaScript
```
/**
 * @param {number[][]} ranges
 * @param {number} left
 * @param {number} right
 * @return {boolean}
 */
 var isCovered = function(ranges, left, right) {
    const diff = new Array(52).fill(0)
    for (const pair of ranges) {
        diff[pair[0]] += 1
        diff[pair[1] + 1] -= 1
    }

    let curr = 0
    for (let i = 0; i < 51; i++) {
        curr += diff[i]
        if (i >= left && i <= right && curr <=0) return false
    }

    return true
};
```

## Time and space complexity
- Time complexity: $O(n + l)$, `n` is the length of `ranges` and `l` is the length of `diff`. The complexity of initializing the `diff` array is $O(l)$, traversing `ranges` array's complexity is $O(n)$ and the time complexity of solving the `prefix` sum and judging whether it is completely covered is $O(l)$;
- Space complexity: $O(l)$, `l` is the length of `diff`
