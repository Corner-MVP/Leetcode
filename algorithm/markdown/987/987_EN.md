# 987. Vertical Order Traversal of a Binary Tree

## Description
Given the `root` of a binary tree, calculate the **vertical order traversal** of the binary tree.

For each node at position `(row, col)`, its left and right children will be at positions `(row + 1, col - 1)` and `(row + 1, col + 1)` respectively. The root of the tree is at `(0, 0)`.

The **vertical order traversal** of a binary tree is a list of top-to-bottom orderings for each column index starting from the leftmost column and ending on the rightmost column. There may be multiple nodes in the same row and same column. In such a case, sort these nodes by their values.

Return *the **vertical order traversal** of the binary tree*.

## Examples
### example 1
```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[9],[3,15],[20],[7]]
Explanation:
Column -1: Only node 9 is in this column.
Column 0: Nodes 3 and 15 are in this column in that order from top to bottom.
Column 1: Only node 20 is in this column.
Column 2: Only node 7 is in this column.
```

### example 2
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Output: [[4],[2],[1,5,6],[3],[7]]
Explanation:
Column -2: Only node 4 is in this column.
Column -1: Only node 2 is in this column.
Column 0: Nodes 1, 5, and 6 are in this column.
          1 is at the top, so it comes first.
          5 and 6 are at the same position (2, 0), so we order them by their value, 5 before 6.
Column 1: Only node 3 is in this column.
Column 2: Only node 7 is in this column.

```

### example 3
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,6,5,7]
Output: [[4],[2],[1,5,6],[3],[7]]
Explanation:
This case is the exact same as example 2, but with nodes 5 and 6 swapped.
Note that the solution remains the same since 5 and 6 are in the same location and should be ordered by their values.
```

### constraints
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 1000`

## Idea
We can traverse the binary tree from root node. During traversal, we store node's width `width`，height `height` and node value `value` in array `node`. After traversal, we can sort `node` by `width`, `height` and `value`.

After the sorting is completed, we also need to put all the nodes with same width into the same array according to the requirements of the title. Therefore, we can traverse `nodes` again, and record the column number of the previous node `current` during the traversal. If the column number of the currently traversed node `width` is equal to `current`, then the node will be placed in the same array as the previous node, otherwise it will be placed in a different array.

## Code
### Python
```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def verticalTraversal(self, root):
        if not root: return []
        self.node = []
        self.dfs(root, 0, 0)
        self.node.sort()

        current = self.node[0][0]
        res = [[]]

        for width, height, value in self.node:
            
            if width == current:
                res[-1].append(value)
            else:
                res.append([value])
                current = width
        return res

    
    def dfs(self, root, height, width):
        if not root: return
        self.node.append((width, height, root.val))
        self.dfs(root.left, height+1, width-1)
        self.dfs(root.right, height+1, width+1)
```

### JavaScript
```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {number[][]}
 */
 var verticalTraversal = function(root) {
    const node = []
    const dfs = (root, height, width) => {
        if (root === null) return
        node.push([width, height, root.val])
        dfs(root.left, height + 1, width - 1)
        dfs(root.right, height + 1, width + 1)
    }
    dfs(root, 0, 0)
    node.sort((tuple1, tuple2) => {
        if (tuple1[0] !== tuple2[0]) return tuple1[0] - tuple2[0]
        else if (tuple1[1] !== tuple2[1]) return tuple1[1] - tuple2[1]
        else return tuple1[2] - tuple2[2]
    })
    let curr = node[0][0]
    const res = [[]]
    
    for (let pair of node) {
        const width = pair[0], value = pair[2]
        if (width === curr) {
            res[res.length - 1].push(value)
        } else {
            res.push([value])
            curr = width
        }
    }

    return res

};
```

## Time and space complexity
- time complexity: $O(nlog(n))$, `n` is the number of node, firstly, we need $O(n)$ to traverse the binary tree, and then $O(nlog(n))$ used in sorting array `arr`, therefore, the total time complexity is $O(nlog(n))$;
- space complexity: $O(n)$, depth first search need $O(n)$ space, at the same time, `node` needs $O(n)$ space.
