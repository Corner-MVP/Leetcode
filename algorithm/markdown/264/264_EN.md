# 264. Ugly Number II

## Description
An **ugly number** is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to `2`, `3`, and `5`.

Given an integer `n`, return *the* $n^th$ ***ugly number***.

## Examples
### example 1
```
Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12] is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
```

### example 2
```
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
```

### constraints
- `1 <= n <= 1690`

## Idea
The factors of ugly number are `2`, `3` and/or `5`, therefore, every ugly number comes from former ugly number multiplied by `2`, `3` and/or `5`. 

Array `dp` is the sequence of ugly number from small to large, `p2`, `p3` and `p5` is index where `2`, `3` and `5` can mutiple with which ugly number in dp respectively. All the initial value of `p1`, `p2` and `p5` are `1`, which means mutiple with the first ugly number. The next ugly number`dp[i] = mini_num = min(dp[p2] * 2, dp[p3] * 3, dp[p5] * 5)` and the index of factor which is the factor of mini_num will add 1. For example, in `dp[1] * 2, dp[1] * 3, dp[1] * 5`, `dp[i] * 2` is the next ugly number and the `p2` will add 1, namely `p2 += 1`.

## Code
### Python
```
class Solution:
    def nthUglyNumber(self, n):
        dp = [0] * (n+1)
        dp[1] = 1
        p2, p3, p5 = 1, 1, 1

        for i in range(2, n+1):
            target = min(dp[p2] * 2, dp[p3] * 3, dp[p5] * 5)
            dp[i] = target
            if target == dp[p2] * 2: p2 += 1
            if target == dp[p3] * 3: p3 += 1
            if target == dp[p5] * 5: p5 += 1

        return dp[n]
```

### JavaScript
```
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var nthUglyNumber = function(n) {
    const dp = new Array(n+1).fill(0);
    dp[1] = 1;
    let p2 = 1, p3 = 1, p5 = 1;

    for (let i = 2; i < n+1; i++) {
      const mini_num = Math.min(dp[p2] * 2, dp[p3] * 3, dp[p5] * 5)
      dp[i] = mini_num
      if (mini_num === dp[p2] * 2) p2 += 1
      if (mini_num === dp[p3] * 3) p3 += 1
      if (mini_num === dp[p5] * 5) p5 += 1
    }

    return dp[n]

};
```

## Time and space complexity
- time complexity: $O(n)$, there are `n` elements in dp need to be computed and each computation takes $O(1)$;
- space complexity: $O(n)$, array `dp` need $O(n)$ space.
