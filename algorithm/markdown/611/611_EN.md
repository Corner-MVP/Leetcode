# 611. Valid Triangle Number

## Description
Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of triplets chosen from the array that can make triangles if we take them as side lengths of a triangle.

## Examples
### example 1
```
Input: nums = [2,2,3,4]
Output: 3
Explanation: Valid combinations are: 
2,3,4 (using the first 2)
2,3,4 (using the second 2)
2,2,3
```

### example 2
```
Input: nums = [4,2,3,4]
Output: 4
```

### constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

## Idea
`a`, `b`, `c` are the side length of triangle. According to triangle theorem, the sum of two sides of any trangle is geater than the third side. When `a <= b <= c`, the three side length just need to meet `a + b > c`. Therefore, the question is equal to in a sort array, when fix smaller two sides of triangle, which is in the `nums` is `nums[i]`, `nums[j]` (`i < j`), find the largest `c`(subscript is `k`) that satisfies `nums[k] < nums[i] + nums[j]`. All the elements, with subscript from `j+1` to `k`, satisfies inequality. Through loop, fixing different `i` and `j`, we can find corresponding `k`. And the sum of them is the final answer.

## Code
### Python
```
class Solution:
    def triangleNumber(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        res = 0
        nums.sort()
        for i in range(n):
            k = i
            for j in range(i+1, n):
                while k + 1 < n and nums[k + 1] < nums[i] + nums[j]:
                    k += 1
                res += max(k - j , 0)
        return res
```

### JavaScript
```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
 var triangleNumber = function(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b)
    let res = 0

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      let k = i
      for (let j = i+1; j < n; j++) {
        while (k + 1 < n && nums[k+1] < nums[i] + nums[j]) {
          k += 1
        }
        res += Math.max(k - j , 0)
      }
    }

    return res

};
```

## Time and space complexity
- time complexity: $O(n^2)$, `n` is the length of `nums`, firstly, we need $O(nlog(n))$ to sort array. And then, we need $O(n^2)$ to use a loop to enumerate the subscripts of `a` and use double pointers to maintain the subscripts of `b` and `c`;
- space complexity: $O(log(n))$, $O(log(n))$ used in sort.
