# 1104. Path In Zigzag Labelled Binary Tree

## Description
In an infinite binary tree where every node has two children, the nodes are labelled in row order.

In the odd numbered rows (ie., the first, third, fifth,...), the labelling is left to right, while in the even numbered rows (second, fourth, sixth,...), the labelling is right to left.

Given the `label` of a node in this tree, return the labels in the path from the root of the tree to the node with that `label`.

## Examples
### example 1
```
Input: label = 14
Output: [1,3,4,14]
```

### example 2
```
Input: label = 26
Output: [1,2,6,10,26]
```

### constraints
- $1 <= label <= 10^6$

## Idea
This question actually equals to find a path from root node to target node. By binary tree characteristic, the number of node in each level is $2^0$, $2^1$, $2^2$ ... $2^{(n-1)}$. From the question,  the nodes are labelled in row order, therefore, the target node's level can be got, namely `index`. And with these characteristics, we can deduce which element of the layer of `label` is located, and its parent node is several elements of the layer where the parent node is located, so that each element in the path can be deduced from bottom to top by analogy.

Assuming that `label` is at the `index+1` level of the binary tree, then the element at the beginning of this layer is $2^{index}$, because each node has two child nodes, it can be inferred that its parent node is the current level direction The $idx = \frac{(label-2^{index})}{2} + 1$ elements on the above, according to the arrangement characteristics of odd and even rows, we can get:
- when`index+1`is odd, $parentNode = 2^{index} - idx$ 
- when`index+1`is even, $parentNode = 2^{(index-1)} + 2^{(index-1)} - idx = 2^{index} - idx$

So the two can be combined.

## Code
### Python
```
class Solution:
    def pathInZigZagTree(self, label):

        index = 1
        while pow(2, index) <= label:
            index += 1
        
        index -= 1

        res = [label]
        while index > 0:
            temp = (label - pow(2, index)) // 2 + 1
            idx = pow(2, index) - temp
            res.insert(0, idx)
            label = idx
            index -= 1
        
        return res
```

### JavaScript
```
/**
 * @param {number} label
 * @return {number[]}
 */
 var pathInZigZagTree = function(label) {
    
    const res = [label]
    let index = 1
    while (2 ** index <= label) {
        index += 1
    }
    index -= 1

    while (index > 0) {
        const temp = Math.floor((label - 2 ** index) / 2) + 1
        const idx = 2 ** index - temp
        res.unshift(idx)
        label = idx
        index -= 1
    }

    return res

};
```

## Time and space complexity
- Time complexity: $O(log(label))$, the depth of binary tree where `label` is in is $log(label)$. Therefore, the distance from root node to `label` is $log(label)$, every node in path can be computed in $O(1)$, thus, the total time complexity is $O(log(label))$;
- Space complexity: $O(1)$,
