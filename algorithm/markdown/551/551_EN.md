# 551. Student Attendance Record I

## Description
You are given a string `s` representing an attendance record for a student where each character signifies whether the student was absent, late, or present on that day. The record only contains the following three characters:

- `'A'`: Absent.
- `'L'`: Late.
- `'P'`: Present.

The student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet **both** of the following criteria:

- The student was absent (`'A'`) for **strictly** fewer than 2 days **total**.
- The student was **never** late (`'L'`) for 3 or more **consecutive** days.

Return `true` *if the student is eligible for an attendance award, or* `false` *otherwise*.

## Examples
### example 1
```
Input: s = "PPALLP"
Output: true
Explanation: The student has fewer than 2 absences and was never late 3 or more consecutive days.
```

### example 2
```
Input: s = "PPALLL"
Output: false
Explanation: The student was late 3 consecutive days in the last 3 days, so is not eligible for the award.`
```

### constraints
- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s[i]` is either `'A'`, `'L'`, or `'P'`.

## Idea
Only one traversal can get the final result. During the traversal, record the student's absent value(`absent`) and continous late value(`late`)
- if encounter `A`, `absent` add 1;
- if meet `L`, `late` add 1, otherwise get max `late` and clear the `late`.

After traversal, if `absent < 2 and max(late) < 3` return `true`, otherwise return `false`.

## Code
### Python
```
class Solution:
    def checkRecord(self, s):
        n = len(s)
        absent, late, i = 0, 0, 0
        while i < n:
            if s[i] == 'A':
                absent += 1
            elif s[i] == 'L':
                index = 0
                while i < n and s[i] == 'L':
                    i += 1
                    index += 1
                i -= 1
                late = max(late, index)
            i += 1
        
        return True if late < 3 and absent < 2 else False
```

### JavaScript
```
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {boolean}
 */
 var checkRecord = function(s) {
  n = s.length;
  let absent = 0, late = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i ++) {
      if (s[i] === 'A') {
          absent += 1;
      } else if (s[i] === 'L') {
          let index = 0;
          while (i < n && s[i] === 'L') {
              i += 1;
              index += 1;
          }
          i -= 1;
          late = Math.max(index, late);
      }
  }
  return absent < 2 && late < 3 ? true : false;
};
```

## Time and space complexity
- time complexity: $O(n)$, `n` is the length of string `s`, traversal string onece can get the final answer;
- space complexity: $O(1)$.
